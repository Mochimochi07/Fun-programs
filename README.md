# Fun-programs
This is my Code repository for codes. I make this repository to be a stress relieving collection of programs. When coding becomes boring, i would think that i would really want to commit fun programs in this repo just to exercise my own curiosity through fun. Sometimes i really feel bored on coding and sometimes i reaally want to learn. Its kind of hard to take those in but making things a little fun would really spice my day. I dont know what type of language i will use but ill try to upload something fun to code.
